This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays. The `BuggyArray.java` file contains the erroneous code, resulting in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The corrected code is provided in `FixedArray.java`.  This example highlights the importance of careful array index handling in Java to prevent runtime exceptions.
